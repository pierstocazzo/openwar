Heightmap: 2^n + 1 pixels, Groundtype: 2^n      Heightmap has -1 pixel offset for x and y. Example: heightmap pixel (50,50) is types pixel (51,51)


Standard tiles:



These 12 tiles all differ visually so are therefore mentioned first
There is a shaderwise (GLSL) restriction to max. 16 textures per pass and because 
we render the terrain in one pass these 12 textures need to be all the visual tiles

name                tile nr.    Description

desert                  0       standard sandy desert tile             
desert fertile          1       standard desert tile with agriculture
desert rough            2       a variant of sand that looks more rough, stony
desert hilly            3       a tile for elevated and more rough desert terrain
grass                   4       standard "european" grass
grass fertile           5       grass that has agriculture on it
grass rough             6       more rough version, less grass and more stones
grass hilly             7       to be used for elevated grassy terrain
grass forest            8       this is the ground for dense forests
snow                    9       a standard snowy plain
swamp                   10      as name suggests, swampy terrain
mountains               11      snow topped mountains


There are more ground types and types that share the same visual tile:

beach                   12      looks like tile 0, boats can land here
shallow water           13      looks like tile 0, determines sailing speed        
deep water              14      looks like tile 0, determines sailing speed 
ocean                   15      looks like tile 0, determines sailing speed 
impassable              16      looks like tile 11, but can never be walked on


Ground types affect: walkability and speed, attrition, fort placement and battle odds
